# Hi, I'm Matthias!

I'm a Web Developer focused on building frontends and constant learner. I started building Websites around 2003 using basic HTML, CSS, PHP and MySQL (I didn't use tables for layouts - I swear).
My current go-to stack consists of technologies like React.js (or Next.js), GraphQL, MongoDB (or Firebase) and more. I'm also a fan and early-adopter of TailwindCSS.
